Project Notes</h2>
<hr  />
<p>The Load Master™ Project is the culmination of a bunch of different attempts and failures to try and bring about a simple load tracking and accounting package for one-truck owner/operator businesses. I believe that I finally have figured out exactly what I want this system to do and how to do it. The next step is to actually implement my ideas into code and see what comes of it. This file contains the overview of how things should work...</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
1. Basic Overview</h2>
<p>The typical way that a one-truck owner/operator runs freight is as follows: </p><pre class="fragment">1. Locates a load by whatever means the owner uses.
2. Books the load.
3. Makes the pick-up(s).
4. Makes the delivery(ies).
5. Completes the load paperwork.
6. Submits the load paperwork, including the proof of delivery (POD) for
   payment on the load.
7. Receives a settlement for the load (after submitting the load paperwork,
   including an invoice, if necessary).
8. Distributes settlement to multiple expense and asset accounts for his/her
   accounting system.
9. Repeats the process for the next load.
</pre><p>In this general overview, there are other details, such as arrival/departure notices for each stop on the load. These types of activities will be included within the work flow of Load Master. Other details that could take place during a typical load, include: </p><pre class="fragment">a. Arriving at a pick-up.
b. Departing from a pick-up.
c. Taking an advance on payment of the load.
d. Arriving at a delivery.
e. Departing from a delivery.
f. Closing a load.
</pre><p>During the course of a load, the owner/operator may: </p><pre class="fragment">1. Fuel up the truck.
2. Replace tires on the truck and/or trailer.
3. Have a breakdown and repair.
4. Have PM service performed.
</pre><p>With all of this in mind, it would be nice to be able to have some of the accounting automated to place the above processes directly into the accounting system at the time they are performed. Therefore, Load Master™ will not be in the least a standard accounting or load tracking system. Instead, Load Master™ will have very few functions that are based on how owner/operators run the course of their business. The way Load Master will handle all of this is: </p><pre class="fragment">1. Book the load.
    This feature will allow the owner/operator to actually enter the 
    details of the load they are preparing to run. This wizard will 
    allow for the entry of all of the load details, such as trip and 
    order numbers, pick-up and delivery customers (unlimited in the 
    number of stops on the load), gross pay for the load, weight of 
    the load's freight, number of miles on the load, piece count of 
    the load, BOL number, as well as various other load-related 
    information.

2. Arrive/Depart Stops.
    This feature will allow the driver to track his/her status on 
    the load by letting the system know when they have arrived and 
    departed the stops that make up the load. This information will 
    update the load progress bar on the bottom of the window in the 
    status area.

3. Enter Fuel Purchase.
    This feature will allow the driver to enter a fuel purchase at 
    any time, whether currently on a booked load or not. The fuel 
    purchase requires various information regarding the purchase, 
    such as the number of gallons purchase, the price per gallon, 
    diesel or DEF, whether or not it is a partial fill-up, location 
    of the purchase, odometer reading at the time of the purchase, 
    etc. This information allows the system to track the fuel expense 
    for the truck and be able to provide the fuel economy and expense 
    per mile.

4. Enter Service Purchase.
    This feature allows the driver to enter the purchase of a service 
    or repair on the truck or trailer. This type of a purchase entry, 
    like the fuel purchase, may be entered whether or not the driver 
    is currently on a booked load and also requires certain information, 
    such as: odometer reading, type of service or repair, component 
    system to which the service or repair belongs, date of the service 
    or repair, etc. By providing as much data as is practical, the 
    system will be able to track the cost per mile of services/repairs.

5. Enter Other Purchases.
    This feature allows the driver to enter any other, uncategorized, 
    purchase, whether or not currently running on a booked load. By 
    using this feature, the accounting system behind Load Master will 
    be able to assist the owner/operator with budgeting for their 
    business by showing where their money comes from and where it goes. 
    The more purchases that are tracked in this system, the better 
    understanding of the cash flow of the business can be had.

6. Close Load.
    This feature simply provides a means by which the owner/operator can 
    let the system know that a load has been completed. The Close Load 
    feature should only be used once a load has been totally completed, 
    including sending in the POD/Signed BOL. If the system settings have 
    the company set up as independent, then closing the load will print 
    a detailed invoice for the load.

7. Settle Load.
    This feature allows the owner/operator to split his/her load 
    settlement into as many accounts as necessary. For example, if the 
    O/O is leased to a carrier, then the settlement sheet s/he receives 
    once the load is complete will have a breakdown of how much was 
    retained by the carrier to which they are leased for, but not limited 
    to:

        - Bobtail insurance
        - Tractor liability insurance
        - Trailer liability insurance
        - QualComm/PeopleNet fees
        - Advances
        - Advance fees
        - Baseplates
        - Electronic bank deposit
        - Reserve account deposit

    The Settle Load feature allows the driver to split the gross load 
    payment out to as many accounts as necessary, which allows the 
    accounting system to be able to accurately break down every expense 
    and revenue to a per mile value. Using the Settle Load feature, like 
    all of the Purchase Entry features, allows the owner/operator to have 
    the best information available to know the financial health of their 
    business.
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
2. Accounting System</h2>
<p>Load Master™ takes care of most of the accounting for you as you simply do what you must while on the load. For example, when you complete the Load Booking Wizard, if you are not currently on a trip, Load Master™ will prompt you to start the trip. When you start the trip, Load Master™ automatically records the gross revenue to the truck in the Accounts Receivable account. Then, if you take a cash advance for fuel and place it on your fuel card, Load Master™ will generate the transaction in the General Ledger, and reduce the gross revenue on the load by the amount of your cash advance, plus any fee you are charged for placing money on your fuel card. This way, you simply do what you need to do and the accounting is taken care of for you.</p>
<p>Load Master™ comes with a set Chart of Accounts, which is specifically designed for the owner/operator truck driver. Therefore, you need not worry whether the revenue and expenses are being properly tracked. The most extra work that you will need to do is to settle your load once you are paid for it.</p>
<p>To this end, when you receive your settlement sheet from the company that you are leased to, or from the broker or customer you hauled the load for, you simply click on the "Close Load" task and enter the information directly off of your settlement sheet. When you complete this task and click the "Close Load" button, Load Master™ takes care of all of the General Ledger transaction entries, as well as all of the specific account journal entries, for you. With this level of automation, you never need to worry that your General Ledger is not accurate. However, if you want to verify that it is correct, simply run either a Balance Sheet or Profit and Loss report. Those two reports will tell you exactly what the financial health of your compay is at that moment.</p>
<p>Now that you have gotten a general overview of the accounting system, let us look at it in just a little more detail...</p>
<p>As I mentioned, Load Master™ comes with a set Chart of Accounts that are perfect for the owner/operator truck driver. Therefore, let us look at the chart of accounts now:</p>

</table>
<p>As you can see by the numbering scheme, the accounts are broken out into liabilities (9999), expenses (10xxx) and assets (500xx). At the end of the day, the assets should balance out with the expenses and liabilities on your Balance Sheet report. However, you will be able to tell by watching the lower-left corner of the main Load Master™ window how your company is doing at any given moment. This is because whenever Load Master™ makes an entry in the General Ledger, or any of the other account journals, numerous calculations are executed to always give you the latest per mile breakdown of your revenue and expenses, as well as your fuel economy, provided that you are entering your fuel stops into the system.</p>
