Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\hypertarget{md_Forked_LoadMaster_CODE-OF-CONDUCT_autotoc_md42}{}\doxysection{Scope}\label{md_Forked_LoadMaster_CODE-OF-CONDUCT_autotoc_md42}
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-\/mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\hypertarget{md_Forked_LoadMaster_CODE-OF-CONDUCT_autotoc_md43}{}\doxysection{Enforcement}\label{md_Forked_LoadMaster_CODE-OF-CONDUCT_autotoc_md43}
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting us anonymously through \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchEuADOxfIsX1C5EQ_KYwhy400Xv4_b5dx42IkILIypdvjQQ/viewform}{\texttt{ this form}}. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project\textquotesingle{}s leadership.

If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by our Code of Conduct, {\bfseries{we encourage you to still report it}}. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, than to leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved that may result in an individual or group to feel like they can no longer participate in the community. Reports deemed as not a violation will also allow us to improve our Code of Conduct and processes surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous situation or someone in distress, we encourage you to report even if you are only an observer.\hypertarget{md_Forked_LoadMaster_CODE-OF-CONDUCT_autotoc_md44}{}\doxysection{Attribution}\label{md_Forked_LoadMaster_CODE-OF-CONDUCT_autotoc_md44}
