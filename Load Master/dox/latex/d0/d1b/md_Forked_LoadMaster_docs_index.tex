Pekin\+S\+O\+F\+T™ Systems is proud to present Load\+Master™ Load Tracking and Accounting for owner/operator truck drivers! This project has been in the planning stages for approximately two years and is finally reached the development phase. We are working hard on getting to our first release, which will hopefully be by the end of 2020. A lot of activity has been taking place on our repository, and there is still a lot more to come.

If you are a developer, regardless of your level of experience, Pekin\+S\+O\+F\+T™ would love to have you as part of our team as a contributor. If you are able to speak a language, or more than one, other than English, we would love for you to participate by providing transalations for our software. If you are a technical writer, we could use a quality, well-\/written help system. There are many ways for people to contribute and we would love to \href{mailto:sean@pekinsoft.com}{\texttt{ hear from you}}!\hypertarget{md_Forked_LoadMaster_docs_index_autotoc_md46}{}\doxysubsection{Programming Environment}\label{md_Forked_LoadMaster_docs_index_autotoc_md46}
We at Pekin\+S\+O\+F\+T™ believe in freedom at every level. Therefore, we tend to develop our software in languages that allow our users the freedom to use whatever operating system(s) they choose. To facilitate this with Load\+Master™, we are developing the project in the Java™ programming language and using the Net\+Beans I\+DE for our development environment.

Having said that, let us set you at ease if you were contemplating contributing to our project, but have your own preferred development environment for Java™. We do not require you to use Net\+Beans, as long as you properly set up your {\ttfamily .gitignore} file to not push your I\+D\+E-\/specific files to the repository. As we said, we believe in freedom at every level!\hypertarget{md_Forked_LoadMaster_docs_index_autotoc_md47}{}\doxysubsection{Support or Contact}\label{md_Forked_LoadMaster_docs_index_autotoc_md47}
